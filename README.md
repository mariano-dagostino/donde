# Donde

Donde (_donde_ means _where_ in Spanish) is a simple App to define points in
a map and filter them using categories.

This project is designed to be a flexible and integrate with other Applications.

## Use case

Let say you need to create a site to show some places that need volunteers
and can receive donations. Volunteers and Donations in this case are the
available categories. Each category will have different items (Volunteers:
Medics, Programmers, Teachers), (Donations: Books, Food, Clothes, etc).

The data will be consumed from another application or directly from some json
files, and the map and the list of available category terms be automatically
displayed. When users click on certain category, the places categorized used
that term will be displayed in the map.
